# Smokeview Manuals

Smokeview manuals are contained within the above directories. Each directory contains a bash script named `make_guide.sh` 
and a windows batch file named `make_guide.bat` that run PDF-LaTeX and BibTeX enough times to compile the guide and update the references. Each directory contains sub-directories `FIGURES` and `SCRIPT_FIGURES`, the latter containing figures that are generated by scripts and not committed to the repository.
