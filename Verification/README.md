##  Smokeview Verification

The smv/Verification/Visualization and smv/Verification/WUI directories contain FDS input files that are run by smokebot 
to verify fds results from a visualization perspective
whenever FDS or Smokeview source source code changes.  The smokebot script is contained in the repository 
[firemodels/bot](https://github.com/firemodels/bot). 

### Introduction 

The Smokeview Verification Suite is a set of FDS and CFAST input files that are designed to test the functionality and accuracy of various Smokeview routines. These cases are run and processed with each maintenance release of Smokeview.  They are also run
by smokebot whenever FDS or Smokeview source changes.

The Smokeview Verification Suite must be run in order to compile the Smokeview User and Verification Guides. Most of the User and Verification Guide figures are generated by running Smokeview on these cases.

The input files are located in the Verification\Visualization and Verification\Wui repository directories. Scripts are used to automate this process.

### Required Software
